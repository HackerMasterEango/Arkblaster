# Arkblaster AI

highly advanced ai for taking arknights gameplay to the next level. Using quantum learning methodology to do so. Quantum learning
is the combination of machine learning and quantum physics that takes AI to new frontier. Differential topology is also
heavily utilized here. Arkblaster is not the only arknights AI but  it is the first open sourced one as far as I'm aware. Most players
privatized their AI but are using them. Basically no one would waste time in their day figuring out the best low rarity clear guide. We just
use AI for that. With Arkblaster releasing to the public I hope to take more peoples gameplay to the next level. This program prints random 
matrices and does nothing by the way.
